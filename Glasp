## **Introduction:**

Glasp is an AI-powered web-based tool that helps you collect and organize quotes and ideas from the web. It is available for both Android and iOS. It functions like a highlighter for the internet that you can use to save information without switching between different screens. It’s ideal for people who want to keep track of their research or build a digital library of their favorite ideas. Kazuki Nishioka and his team created Glasp, aiming to** “Create a system that allows everyone to share and develop their learnings as their legacy in a natural way.”**

He realized that these messages from our predecessors were from a very limited number of people. Of the knowledge of tens of billions of people who have existed in human history, only a handful have survived in the form of books and traditions. He thought this was a problem, and at the same time, wondered how different the world would be if the rest of humanity had the power to preserve their learning and experiences for future generations. If only there was some kind of central repository for thoughts and ideas, then there could be progress, and Glasp is what he envisions as this repository.
